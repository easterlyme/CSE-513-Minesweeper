<h1> Programmer's Minesweeper </h1>

Programmer's Minesweeper (PGMS) is a game based on the Minesweeper
game delivered with most Microsoft Windows operating systems.  In that
game, a grid of cells is presented to the player.  If the player
probes a cell with a mine, the game is lost.  If the player probes a
cell without a mine, the player learns the number of mines that are
adjecent to the probed cell.  This information can often be used to
choose another cell for probing without fear it has a mine.  The game
is won when every cell without a mine has been probed.
<p>

In this version of Minesweeper, a <a
href="http://java.sun.com">Java</a> program plays the game.
Minesweeper players sometimes enjoy watching the computer play an <a
href="eqnexpert.html">expert</a> game, and learn to use some of its
tricks. <p>

Programmer's Minesweeper has been designed so that Java programmers
can easily implement their own strategy for winning a Minesweeper
game.  A very simple strategy has been implemented called the <a
href="doc/sp.SinglePointStrategy.html">Single Point Strategy.</a>
Click on the start button in the mine map below to see it play a
beginner game.  A yellow cell indicates a mine with a location unknown
to the strategy, a blue cell indicates a mine correctly marked by the
strategy, a red cell indicates an exploded mine, and a black cell
indicates an incorrectly marked cell.
